If you successfully assassinate your target, using one of the kill methods described in üíÄ-kill-methods, you receive a reward and a new target (your target's former target).\n\t- Assassinating your target removes them from the game.\n3. In order to prevent the game from stalling, there will be a weekly  Town Hall phase (Sunday 00:00 CDT -> 23:59 CDT)\n\t- Players vote for various new kill methods players have proposed throughout the week.\n\t- A portion of the players with the least kills are eliminated by vote. \n\t- Participation is optional, but participants are rewarded.\n\t- See üè´-town-hall-info for specific information.\n4. At the end of the game, two players will have each other as targets, and whoever kills the other will be crowned the champion and receive a large reward. (if for some reason the game ends with more players, all those remaining will win)\n\n**How to join Cyclic Games Assassin**\n\n**Before you join**\n\n**You *do not* have to attend anything to play the game, it's all throughout the next few weeks. So, if you're busy a certain day, it's fine.**\n**1.** Register an account and fill in the necessary information at http://www.cyclic.games/autoJoin/2.\n\t - You **MUST** use your @illinois.edu email to verify that you are a student.\n\t- If you do not use the link above, manually join game number 00000002.\n**2.** Venmo $5.50 to @Evan-Coats. Make sure to include your __discord tag__ in the message, so we can confirm who sent the money.\n\t- This amount is **REFUNDABLE** if you do not play the game, so you have nothing to lose if you decide against playing!\n\t- Note that you can win money back from the game *without* winning the whole game.\n**3.** If the staff does not add you to the @active game member role, please contact them in #üé§-general.\n**4.** Check out the rules of the game in #üìã-rules."
